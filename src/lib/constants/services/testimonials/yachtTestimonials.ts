      "We’ve charted yachts before, but never like this. From Corsican wine pairings to a surprise underwater drone show for our children, every detail was imagined in advance. The captain and crew made us feel like royalty—without a hint of pretension.",

    quote:
      "Our anniversary sail through the Greek isles became a second honeymoon. The private chef recreated our wedding dinner, and the crew arranged a sunrise vow renewal at sea. It was more than a vacation—it was a memory etched forever.",
