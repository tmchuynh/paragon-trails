        answer:
          "Vanuatu's volcanic soil, tropical climate, and sustainable farming practices create distinctive flavor profiles in both coffee and cacao. The coffee, primarily grown on Tanna Island, has notes of dark chocolate, citrus, and caramel with low acidity. Vanuatu cacao is prized for its rich, fruity profile with hints of tropical fruit. Both industries are relatively small-scale, focused on quality over quantity, with strong emphasis on supporting local communities and sustainable farming methods.",

You'll learn about organic growing methods, shade-grown cultivation techniques that preserve forest canopy, natural pest management systems, and water conservation practices. Both the coffee and cacao plantations feature intercropping techniques that maintain biodiversity. The tour also covers fair trade practices and how purchasing these products directly supports local farming communities.",

        question: "Will the tour be different depending on the season?",

Cacao pods can be found year-round but peak harvest season is April-August. Regardless of timing, you'll see plants at various stages and participate in whatever seasonal activities are underway. The processing, roasting, and chocolate-making demonstrations are available year-round.",

          "The trip requires a moderate level of fitness. While 4WD vehicles take you most of the way up the volcano, the final approach involves a 10-15 minute walk up a steep but well-maintained path on volcanic ash and rock. The rim viewing area has uneven terrain. Participants should be comfortable walking on unpredictable surfaces and standing for extended periods. The elevation is not high enough to cause altitude sickness.",

The volcano rim can be windy and significantly cooler than the coast. Bring a light rain jacket, sun protection, and a small backpack for personal items.
