December to May is the warm season with calmer seas and better underwater visibility, ideal for snorkeling. June to November is cooler with nutrient-rich waters attracting more marine life. Many species have specific breeding or nesting seasons, so we can customize your trip depending on which animals you're most interested in seeing.",

        question: "What should I bring for birdwatching?",
        answer:
          "We recommend lightweight, breathable clothing suitable for warm weather, sturdy walking shoes, a wide-brimmed hat, and plenty of sunscreen. Bring a refillable water bottle, binoculars (if you have your own), a notebook for field notes, and a camera with a zoom lens for photography. A light rain jacket is useful during the cooler months (June-November).",
