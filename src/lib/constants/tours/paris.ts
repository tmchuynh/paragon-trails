        question: "How much walking and stair climbing is involved?",
        answer:
          "This tour involves moderate walking (about 2.5 km) with some hills and cobblestone streets. We use the funicular to avoid the main staircase to Sacré-Cœur, but there are still some unavoidable steps in this hillside neighborhood. Comfortable walking shoes are strongly recommended.",

        question: "Will we have time to get our portrait drawn by an artist?",
        answer:
          "The guided tour doesn't include time for sitting for a portrait, which typically takes 30-45 minutes. However, your guide will point out the best artists in Place du Tertre, and you're welcome to return after the tour concludes to have your portrait done.",
