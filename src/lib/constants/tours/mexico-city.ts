          "The Great Pyramid of Cholula is mostly covered by natural growth and a Spanish colonial church built on top. Unlike other pyramids, you cannot climb its exterior. However, our tour includes access to the impressive network of excavated tunnels running through the pyramid, offering a unique perspective on its construction. We'll also visit the church on top with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape and volcanoes.",

        question: "Why are these murals so important in Mexican culture?",
        answer:
          "The Mexican Mural Movement emerged after the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) as a way to reunify the country and establish a new national identity. The government commissioned artists to create art that would be accessible to all citizens, including the illiterate population. These murals tell the complex story of Mexico's history, celebrate indigenous heritage, critique colonialism and capitalism, and imagine a more equitable future. They represent one of Mexico's most significant contributions to world art history.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do we need to know about art history to enjoy this tour?",
        answer:
          "Not at all. Our guides excel at making art accessible to everyone by focusing on the stories, symbols, and historical context behind the murals. You'll learn how to 'read' a mural by understanding the characters, events, and messages depicted. Even those with no background in art typically find these massive, narrative works fascinating once they understand what they're looking at.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are all the mural sites guaranteed to be open?",
        answer:
          "Most sites are reliably open, but the National Palace occasionally closes for official government functions with little notice. If this occurs, we substitute with alternative significant mural sites nearby. The Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) building sometimes has restricted hours; in such cases, we reorganize the itinerary to visit when access is possible.",
