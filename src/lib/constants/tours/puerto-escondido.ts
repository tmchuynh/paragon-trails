The phenomenon is also more vibrant during the warm summer months (April-October) when the microorganisms are most active.

        question: "Is turtle release guaranteed on every tour?",
        answer:
          "While we operate the program year-round, sea turtle nesting and hatching are natural phenomena that follow seasonal patterns. Olive ridley turtles (the most common species here) nest primarily from July to January, with peak releases from August to February. During slower periods, there are still frequently turtles available for release, but numbers may be limited. In the rare event no hatchlings are available, we offer a full educational program with a behind-the-scenes tour of the hatchery and conservation center.",

        question: "Is this activity suitable for children?",
        answer:
          "Absolutely! This is a wonderful family-friendly activity that children particularly enjoy. The experience of helping these tiny creatures is both educational and emotionally rewarding for kids. Our guides are skilled at engaging children with age-appropriate information about turtle conservation. Children must be supervised by adults during the release process to ensure both their safety and the turtles' wellbeing.",
      },
      {
        question: "How does this activity help sea turtle conservation?",
        answer:
          "Your participation directly supports the local conservation program that patrols beaches for nests, relocates eggs to protected hatcheries, and ensures safe release of hatchlings. In nature, only about 1 in 1,000 sea turtles survives to adulthood. By protecting nests from predators, poachers, and beach development, and releasing hatchlings in safe conditions, the program significantly improves survival odds. Your tour fee contributes to equipment, staff, and education programs that sustain this conservation work year-round.",
