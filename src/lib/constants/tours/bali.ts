        question: "What is the Kecak Fire Dance?",
        answer:
          "The Kecak Fire Dance is a mesmerizing Balinese performance where a circle of 100+ men create a polyrhythmic sound by chanting 'cak' while moving their arms and upper bodies in a coordinated fashion. The performance tells the story of the Ramayana epic, particularly focusing on Prince Rama's battle with the evil Ravana. The 'fire' element comes when Hanuman sets Ravana's palace aflame during a climactic scene.",

        question: "What should I wear for the temple visit?",
        answer:
          "As with all temple visits in Bali, respectful dress is required. Both men and women must wear a sarong and temple sash (which are provided at the entrance or by your guide). Shoulders should be covered. Comfortable walking shoes are recommended as there are many steps to navigate around the temple complex.",

          "Yes, the temple is home to a large population of macaque monkeys. While they can be entertaining to watch, they are known for being bold and occasionally snatching visitors' belongings, particularly shiny items, glasses, or food. Your guide will provide safety tips for interacting with them. We recommend leaving valuable items secured or on the tour bus.",
      },

        question:
          "What time does the performance start and how long does it last?",

          "The Kecak Fire Dance performance begins just before sunset, typically around 6:00 PM. The performance lasts approximately one hour. The timing is arranged to capitalize on the dramatic golden lighting at sunset, with the finale occurring as darkness falls, creating a magical atmosphere.",
