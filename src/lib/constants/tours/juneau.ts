        question: "When is the best time to see whales in Juneau?",
        answer:
          "The peak whale watching season runs from May through September, with humpback whales being most abundant from June to August. During these months, the waters around Juneau host hundreds of humpbacks that migrate from Hawaii to feed in Alaska's nutrient-rich waters. Orcas (killer whales) are less predictable but are most commonly spotted in May and June. Our captains communicate with each other to maximize wildlife sightings regardless of when you visit within the season.",
      },
      {
        question: "How close will we get to Mendenhall Glacier?",
        answer:
          "From the main visitor center viewpoint, you'll be approximately 0.5 miles from the glacier face, offering excellent photo opportunities. For those who choose the optional Nugget Falls trail (weather permitting), you can get within approximately 0.25 miles of the glacier while standing next to a spectacular 377-foot waterfall. For visitors seeking an even closer glacier experience, we offer separate tours that include glacier trekking or helicopter landings directly on the ice.",
      },
      {
        question: "What wildlife might we see besides whales?",
        answer:
          "While whales are the highlight, the waters around Juneau are teeming with diverse marine and coastal wildlife. Common sightings include Steller sea lions, harbor seals, Dall's porpoises, and bald eagles. Occasionally, visitors may spot black bears along the shoreline, mountain goats on cliffs, or sea otters floating in kelp beds. Our naturalist guides are skilled at spotting wildlife and will help you identify the various species throughout the tour.",

The doctor had contracted tuberculosis and believed the pristine wilderness air would heal his condition – which it did. The lodge has hosted notable guests including Walt Disney in the 1940s and has remained largely unchanged, preserving its rustic Alaskan character. The current owners have maintained the lodge's historical features while operating it as a fly-in destination for over 40 years. The walls are adorned with historical photos and artifacts that tell the story of this remarkable wilderness outpost.",

        answer:
          "While wildlife sightings can never be guaranteed, black bears frequently visit the lodge grounds during salmon grilling times, attracted by the aroma. The bears are wild but accustomed to the lodge operations and typically forage for salmon scraps after cooking. Lodge staff are experienced with bear safety and will provide clear guidelines for safe wildlife viewing. If bears do appear, you'll be able to observe them from a safe distance. Remember these are wild animals in their natural habitat – which is what makes this experience so special.",

We maintain a leisurely pace with frequent stops for interpretation and wildlife viewing. Most people with average fitness find it very manageable.

          "The Tongass is America's largest national forest at 16.7 million acres and represents the world's largest intact temperate rainforest ecosystem. This rare ecosystem type receives over 200 inches of rainfall annually, creating a uniquely lush environment dominated by massive Sitka spruce and western hemlock trees, some over 800 years old. The forest floor is covered with dense mosses, ferns, and fungi that form a complex ecosystem supporting diverse wildlife including bears, eagles, salmon, and wolves. Your guide will explain how this complex ecosystem functions and the conservation efforts to protect it.",

Our expert instructors will teach you proper panning techniques to maximize your findings. Most participants find enough gold flakes to fill their souvenir vial, and occasionally someone discovers a small nugget. The real value, however, is in learning the historical techniques that drove thousands to seek their fortune in Alaska during the gold rush era.",

          "All necessary gold panning equipment is provided. We recommend wearing comfortable clothing that you don't mind getting a bit wet or dirty, as gold panning does involve water and sediment. Closed-toe shoes are required for the mining areas. The panning area is covered, so the activity takes place rain or shine. In cooler weather, bring a light jacket as temperatures can be cooler near the creek where panning takes place.",

        question: "What's the historical significance of mining in Juneau?",

          "Juneau is the only U.S. state capital founded on a gold discovery. In 1880, prospectors Richard Harris and Joe Juneau found gold in what is now known as Gold Creek, leading to Alaska's first major gold rush. The city was built around these mining operations, with the AJ Mine becoming one of Alaska's largest gold producers, operating until 1944. At its peak, the mine employed over 1,000 workers and had 60 miles of underground tunnels. Our tour explores this rich history and its lasting impact on Alaska's development and statehood.",

The initial portion crossing Stephens Passage can occasionally have light to moderate swells depending on weather conditions. Our catamaran design provides a stable platform that minimizes motion.

Our crew can also provide additional suggestions if you begin feeling uncomfortable.",
