        question: "What makes the Minoan civilization unique?",
        answer:
          "The Minoan civilization was Europe's first advanced civilization, flourishing from approximately 2700 to 1420 BCE. It featured sophisticated art, architecture, engineering, and the continent's first writing system. Unlike contemporary civilizations, Minoan culture appears to have been relatively peaceful, with artwork depicting nature and ceremonies rather than warfare and conquests. Their architectural achievements included multi-story buildings with advanced plumbing systems at a time when most of Europe was still in primitive conditions.",

        question: "Is Knossos really the labyrinth from the Minotaur myth?",
        answer:
          "While definitive proof is lacking, many archaeologists believe the complex layout of the Palace of Knossos, with its maze-like structure of over 1,000 interlocking rooms, may have inspired the Greek myth of the labyrinth and Minotaur. Our tour explores the fascinating connections between archaeological evidence and Greek mythology, examining how historical sites often become intertwined with legendary tales.",

      {
        question: "How much of what we see at Knossos is original?",
        answer:
          "This is a fascinating and controversial aspect of Knossos. The site was extensively reconstructed under archaeologist Arthur Evans in the early 20th century. While some reconstructions were based on archaeological evidence, others reflected Evans' own interpretations. Our guide will clearly distinguish between original Minoan structures and later reconstructions, discussing the ongoing debates about Evans' approach to archaeological restoration.",

        question: "What is special about Dia Island?",
        answer:
          "Dia is an uninhabited island and protected natural reserve located about 7 nautical miles north of Heraklion. Legend claims it was created when Zeus turned a giant lizard to stone to protect Crete. The island harbors protected wildlife including the rare Cretan wild goat (kri-kri) and wild rabbits. In the 1970s, Jacques Cousteau discovered ancient Minoan port facilities underwater near the island, suggesting it was an important maritime site 4,000 years ago. Its pristine waters offer some of the best snorkeling in Crete with exceptional visibility and diverse marine life.",

        answer:
          "The traditional Cretan diet forms the foundation of what nutritionists call the 'Mediterranean diet' and is associated with remarkable longevity and low rates of heart disease. Key elements include abundant olive oil (Cretans consume more olive oil per person than anyone in the world), fresh seasonal vegetables and fruits, whole grains, moderate dairy (primarily sheep and goat cheese), limited meat with emphasis on fish, and moderate wine consumption. During the class, you'll learn how these principles translate into delicious, satisfying meals using simple, high-quality ingredients.",
