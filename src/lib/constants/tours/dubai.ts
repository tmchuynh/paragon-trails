While it shares Bedouin heritage and pearl diving history with other Gulf states, Dubai's mercantile tradition and open trade policies distinguish it historically. The tour explores how Dubai's strategic decision in the early 20th century to position itself as a trade hub—offering low customs duties and welcoming merchants from India, Iran and across the Arab world—laid the foundation for its current global status. You'll learn how this commercial DNA influenced Dubai's development differently from oil-dependent neighbors, creating a unique urban and social environment.",

          "Dubai Creek (Khor Dubai) is the historical heart of the city and the reason for Dubai's existence. During our abra crossing, your guide will explain how this natural inlet determined Dubai's development as a trading port and created the division between Deira and Bur Dubai districts. You'll learn how the creek served as Dubai's main commercial artery before modern ports were developed, how traditional dhow boats still actively trade goods to Iran, India, and Africa, and how the creek's dredging in the early 20th century—a visionary but financially risky decision—established Dubai's reputation for ambitious infrastructure projects that continues today.",
