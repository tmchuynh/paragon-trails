Founded in the 13th century as an independent kingdom, it maintains authentic Newari architecture, intricate wood carvings, and living traditions that have continued for centuries. Unlike more touristic destinations, Panauti offers a glimpse of authentic Nepalese cultural life with significantly fewer visitors, making for a more immersive and personal experience.",

        question: "Will I complete a project to take home?",
        answer:
          "Yes, each workshop is designed so participants complete a finished piece within the session timeframe. Wood carvers typically create a small decorative panel with traditional motifs, metal workers produce a small repoussé ornament, and painting participants complete a small thangka featuring simple Buddhist imagery. All pieces are suitable for display and make meaningful souvenirs of your experience in Nepal.",
