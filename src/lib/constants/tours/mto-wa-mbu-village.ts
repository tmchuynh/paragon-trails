        question: "Will we see the famous tree-climbing lions?",
        answer:
          "Lake Manyara is renowned for its tree-climbing lions, but they are wild animals and sightings cannot be guaranteed. Our experienced guides know the best locations and have approximately a 30-40% success rate for lion sightings depending on the season. The park offers abundant other wildlife regardless, including huge elephant herds, giraffes, hippos, and incredible birdlife.",
      },
      {
        question: "When is the best time for this safari?",
        answer:
          "Lake Manyara offers excellent wildlife viewing year-round, but different seasons have unique advantages. The dry season (June-October) concentrates animals around water sources making them easier to spot. The wet season (November-May) offers lush landscapes, newborn animals, migratory birds, and fewer tourists. Flamingo numbers are highest from June to September and November to March.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I wear and bring for the safari?",
        answer:
          "Wear neutral-colored clothing (avoid bright colors and white), lightweight long pants and long-sleeved shirts for sun protection, a wide-brimmed hat, and closed comfortable shoes. Bring sunscreen, insect repellent, sunglasses, personal medications, and a light jacket or sweater as mornings can be cool. A camera with zoom lens, extra batteries, and binoculars are highly recommended.",

      {
        question: "Is hot air ballooning safe?",
        answer:
          "Yes, our hot air balloon safaris maintain the highest safety standards. Our pilots are internationally certified with thousands of flying hours and specific experience in the region. Balloons receive rigorous maintenance and daily inspections. All flights carry appropriate safety equipment and ground crews maintain constant radio contact. Weather forecasts are carefully monitored, and flights may be canceled if conditions are unsuitable, with full refunds or rescheduling offered.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is the balloon capacity and minimum age requirement?",
        answer:
          "Our balloons accommodate 12-16 passengers in a compartmentalized basket that ensures everyone has outside viewing positions. The minimum age is 7 years, and children must be accompanied by an adult and tall enough to see over the edge of the basket (approximately 4ft/1.2m tall). There is no upper age limit, but passengers must be reasonably mobile to climb in and out of the basket and stand for the duration of the flight (approximately one hour).",
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if the weather prevents flying?",
        answer:
          "Balloon flights are weather-dependent and safety is our priority. If our pilot determines conditions are unsuitable, we offer the option to reschedule for another day during your stay or receive a full refund. We typically make the final decision very early on the morning of the flight, which is why we maintain contact with your accommodation. The winds are generally calmest at dawn, making early morning the ideal and safest time to fly.",
