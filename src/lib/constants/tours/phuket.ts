        question: "Will I be able to ride the elephants?",
        answer:
          "No, this sanctuary strictly prohibits elephant riding as it's harmful to elephant health and welfare. Instead, we offer more meaningful interactions like observing, feeding, and walking alongside these magnificent creatures in a respectful environment. This approach allows you to connect with elephants while supporting ethical tourism practices that prioritize animal welfare.",

        question: "Is this experience suitable for children?",
        answer:
          "Yes, this is a family-friendly experience that children typically love. Kids of all ages are welcome, though parents should supervise young children around the elephants. The sanctuary guides are experienced in helping children interact safely and respectfully with the elephants, creating memorable educational experiences for young animal lovers.",

      {
        question: "What should I wear for the elephant sanctuary visit?",
        answer:
          "We recommend comfortable, casual clothing that you don't mind getting dirty, as elephants can sometimes spray water or mud. Wear closed-toe shoes with good traction as pathways may be uneven or muddy. Bring a hat, sunscreen, and insect repellent. The sanctuary provides rain ponchos if needed during rainy season and reusable water bottles to stay hydrated throughout your visit.",
