          "The lavender blooming season in Furano is relatively short, typically from late June to early August, with peak bloom usually occurring in mid-July. The exact timing varies slightly each year depending on weather conditions. Different varieties have staggered blooming periods, so some lavender can be seen throughout the summer season.",

During other seasons, we offer alternative Furano experiences showcasing seasonal highlights: spring tulips, autumn foliage, or winter snow landscapes with different itineraries and activities.",
