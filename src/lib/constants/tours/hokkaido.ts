A sturdy tripod is essential, as is a backup camera body if possible. For landscape work, wide-angle lenses (16-35mm range) and neutral density filters are useful.

They traditionally lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, with deep spiritual connections to nature. After centuries of discrimination and forced assimilation policies, the Japanese government only officially recognized the Ainu as indigenous people in 2019. Today, there is a revitalization of Ainu language, arts, and cultural practices, though there are fewer than 20,000 people who identify as Ainu. This tour provides respectful insight into their heritage while supporting contemporary Ainu cultural practitioners.",
