        answer:
          "Hokkaido's cuisine is distinctly different from the rest of Japan due to its northern climate, vast farmland, and surrounding seas. The region produces 70% of Japan's dairy (rare in traditional Japanese cuisine), exceptional seafood (especially crab, sea urchin, and salmon), and unique crops like corn and potatoes. You'll experience Genghis Khan (grilled lamb), soup curry, fresh dairy desserts, and the freshest sushiâ€”all specialties rarely found with the same quality elsewhere in Japan. Hokkaido's brewing and distilling traditions also produce distinctive sake, beer, and internationally acclaimed whisky.",

A sturdy tripod is essential, as is a backup camera body if possible. For landscape work, wide-angle lenses (16-35mm range) and neutral density filters are useful. Winter conditions require extra batteries (cold depletes them quickly), weather protection for gear, and appropriate gloves that allow camera operation.

The exact dates vary slightly each year and are usually announced in autumn. Our tour is carefully timed to include the peak days of the major festivals while avoiding the most crowded weekends.

          "The Ainu are the indigenous people of Hokkaido, northern Japan, and parts of Russia with a distinct language, religion, and cultural traditions different from mainstream Japanese culture. They traditionally lived by hunting, fishing, and gathering, with deep spiritual connections to nature. After centuries of discrimination and forced assimilation policies, the Japanese government only officially recognized the Ainu as indigenous people in 2019. Today, there is a revitalization of Ainu language, arts, and cultural practices, though there are fewer than 20,000 people who identify as Ainu. This tour provides respectful insight into their heritage while supporting contemporary Ainu cultural practitioners.",
