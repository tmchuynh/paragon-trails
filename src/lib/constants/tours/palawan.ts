        answer:
          "We recommend wearing comfortable, weather-appropriate clothing and sturdy walking shoes. Neutral earth tones (greens, browns, grays) are best for birdwatching as they don't startle wildlife. A hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen are advisable for sun protection. We provide high-quality binoculars and spotting scopes, but if you have your own that you're comfortable with, feel free to bring them. A small daypack for personal items is useful.",
