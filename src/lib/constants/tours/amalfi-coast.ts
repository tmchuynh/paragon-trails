        question: "What makes Amalfi Coast wines unique?",
        answer:
          "The Amalfi Coast's extreme vertical terrain creates a challenging environment for viticulture, with vineyards often planted on terraced cliffs above the sea. This unique geography, combined with indigenous grape varieties and ancient cultivation techniques, produces wines with distinctive minerality and saline characteristics not found elsewhere. Many vineyards are only accessible by foot and require all harvesting to be done by hand, preserving traditional methods that have remained unchanged for centuries.",

      {
        question: "How many wineries do we visit?",
        answer:
          "The tour includes visits to two carefully selected small-production wineries and a tasting session featuring wines from a third producer. This allows you to experience different approaches to winemaking while maintaining a relaxed pace. Each winery offers something unique‚Äîone might focus on indigenous varieties, another on innovative techniques, providing a comprehensive overview of the region's viticulture.",
