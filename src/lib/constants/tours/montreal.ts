This innovative urban solution allows Montrealers to navigate much of downtown without ever facing extreme weather conditions.",

Approximately 70% of the tour takes place in the climate-controlled underground network, while the remainder includes strategic outdoor viewpoints of significant buildings and urban spaces that connect to the system. This mixed approach provides a comprehensive understanding of how the underground integrates with the city above.",
