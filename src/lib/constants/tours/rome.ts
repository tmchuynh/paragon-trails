If the mountain is closed during your tour, we'll substitute with a visit to either Herculaneum (another remarkably preserved site from the same eruption) or the National Archaeological Museum in Naples, which houses many treasures from Pompeii.

        answer:
          "The Borghese Gallery strictly enforces a 2-hour visit policy for all visitors to control crowds and preserve the artwork. The museum operates on a timed entry system, and all visitors must exit at the end of their assigned time slot. Our expert guides are skilled at maximizing this time, focusing on the most significant masterpieces while providing rich context and interpretation.",

          "Photography without flash is permitted in most rooms of the Borghese Gallery for personal use only. Some special exhibitions or specific artworks may have photography restrictions. Video recording is generally not permitted. Photography is freely allowed in the gardens. Your guide will advise about any specific restrictions during the tour.",
      },
      {
        question: "Should I book this tour in advance?",
