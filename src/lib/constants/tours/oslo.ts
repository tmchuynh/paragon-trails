The Oseberg ship (built around 820 AD) is the most complete, with about 90% of the original wood preserved. These vessels were buried in clay as part of Viking funeral rituals, which helped preserve the wood. The museum's controlled environment continues to protect these archaeological treasures, allowing visitors to appreciate the incredible craftsmanship and engineering of Viking shipbuilders.",

        question: "Do I need previous experience with sledding or skating?",
        answer:
          "No previous experience is necessary. Our guides provide complete instruction for beginners, starting with gentle slopes for sledding and basic skating techniques. We gradually progress to more challenging runs as your confidence builds. The activities are designed to be fun and accessible for first-timers while still offering excitement for those with previous winter sports experience.",
      },
      {
        question: "What should I wear for winter activities?",
        answer:
          "Proper winter clothing is essential. We recommend wearing thermal base layers, a warm mid-layer (fleece or wool), and a wind/waterproof outer layer. Warm gloves, a hat, and thick socks are crucial. Snow pants or waterproof pants are strongly recommended for sledding. Warm, waterproof boots with good grip are necessary. While we provide safety equipment, the appropriate clothing is your responsibility.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is this tour suitable for children?",
        answer:
          "Yes, this tour is perfect for families! Children from age 5 and up can participate in the sledding and skating activities. We provide appropriately sized equipment for all ages, and our guides are experienced in teaching winter skills to children. For very young children (ages 5-7), we offer the option of riding on a sled with a parent for the steeper sections.",
