    title: "The Great Wall of China",
    description:
      "An iconic symbol of China, this ancient wall stretches over 13,000 miles and offers breathtaking views. It is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most famous landmarks in the world. Construction began more than 2,300 years ago during the Qin Dynasty and continued through subsequent dynasties, with the most well-preserved sections dating from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Built with stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, the wall served not only as a military defensive structure but also as a border control that regulated trade and immigration. The wall's watchtowers, which are typically spaced at intervals of 100-200 meters, functioned as signal stations and garrison posts. Several sections near Beijing are open to visitors, with Badaling being the most popular and crowded, while Mutianyu and Jinshanling offer equally stunning views with fewer tourists. Hiking the wall reveals dramatic landscapes that change with the seasons, from snow-covered battlements in winter to lush green surroundings in summer.",
