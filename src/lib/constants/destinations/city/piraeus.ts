    description:
      "The largest port in Greece and one of the busiest in Europe, serving as a major gateway for ferries and cruise ships. It is a hub for maritime trade and tourism, connecting the mainland to the Greek islands and beyond. With a history dating back to ancient times, Piraeus has been Athens' port for over 2,500 years, playing a crucial role in establishing Athens as a naval power during the Classical period. Today, the port complex consists of three separate harbors: Mikrolimano for fishing boats, Zea Marina for yachts, and the main commercial port with numerous ferry terminals serving domestic and international routes. As the primary gateway to the Greek islands, it handles over 20 million passengers annually, featuring modern facilities including restaurants, shops, and transportation connections to central Athens via metro, tram, and bus. The bustling atmosphere of arriving and departing vessels creates an exciting introduction to Greek maritime culture for many visitors.",
