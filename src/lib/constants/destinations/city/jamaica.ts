    description:
      "A famous waterfall where visitors can climb the terraced rocks and enjoy the natural pools along the way. This iconic attraction is surrounded by lush tropical vegetation and offers a refreshing experience. It is a must-visit for nature lovers and adventure seekers. Rising approximately 180 feet (55 meters) and extending over 600 feet (183 meters), these travertine waterfalls are one of few in the world that empty directly into the ocean, creating a stunning contrast between the cascading freshwater and the Caribbean Sea. The falls' unique terraced structure was formed over thousands of years as calcium carbonate and sodium deposits from the flowing river water gradually built up on algae and fossilized driftwood. During guided climbs, visitors form human chains to navigate the natural limestone steps, cooling off in crystal-clear pools formed between the terraces. The surrounding Dunn's River Falls Park features lush tropical gardens with native flora, beach access, and facilities including changing rooms, craft markets, and restaurants serving Jamaican specialties like jerk chicken and fresh seafood.",
