    description:
      "A conservation center dedicated to the breeding and protection of giant pandas, offering visitors a chance to see these adorable creatures up close. It features educational exhibits and beautiful gardens to explore. Founded in 1987 with just 6 rescued pandas, the base has grown into a world-renowned breeding and research facility that now houses over 100 pandas in a setting that closely resembles their natural habitat. Spanning 165 acres of bamboo forests, lakes, and rivers, the base has successfully bred more than 300 pandas and pioneered techniques for artificial insemination and cub rearing that have helped bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Visitors can observe pandas at different stages of development, from playful cubs to mature adults, while learning about conservation efforts through interactive displays and documentary screenings. The base also conducts research on other endangered species like red pandas and black-necked cranes, contributing to broader biodiversity conservation in southwest China.",
