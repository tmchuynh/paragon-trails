    description:
      "A historic tower and symbol of the city, offering panoramic views of Thessaloniki and the Aegean Sea. It was built in the 15th century and has served various purposes throughout its history, including as a fortress and a prison. It is now a museum showcasing the city's history and culture. Standing at 34 meters tall, the tower was originally part of the city's Byzantine and Ottoman defensive walls, which were demolished in 1866. Once known as the 'Tower of Blood' due to its use as a prison and execution site during Ottoman rule, it was whitewashed after Greece gained control of the city in 1912, symbolizing a new beginning. Today, its six floors house interactive exhibitions detailing Thessaloniki's 2,300-year history, from its founding by King Cassander of Macedonia to its multicultural present, with special focus on Byzantine art, Jewish heritage, and the city's architectural evolution.",
