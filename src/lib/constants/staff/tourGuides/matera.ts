    bio: "Stefano's understanding of Matera comes from his childhood in a family that never left their sassi home during the government's forced evacuations of the 1950s. Before becoming a guide, he participated in UNESCO documentation projects recording oral histories from elderly residents who remembered traditional cave-dwelling life. Stefano leads tours that explore Matera's remarkable transformation from 'national shame' to world heritage treasure, incorporating his family's seven generations of residence in the same cave complex. With access to private homes and unrestored cave structures, he reveals domestic arrangements and survival techniques developed over millennia of continuous habitation. His specialty archaeological tours include subterranean structures and water systems normally closed to visitors.",
