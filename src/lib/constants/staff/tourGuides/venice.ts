    specialties: ["Cultural Heritage", "Historical Tours", "City Tours"],
    bio: "Marco's approach to Venetian history was shaped by his previous career restoring ancient manuscripts in the Marciana Library, where he gained intimate knowledge of primary historical documents spanning eight centuries of the Republic's history. His tours reconstruct Venice's past through the actual words of those who lived it—from diplomatic correspondence to merchants' logbooks. With special permission to access normally closed archives, Marco can show visitors original documents relating to Venice's most significant historical events. His specialty 'Republic of Merchants' tour traces how this unlikely city of islands became a medieval superpower through revolutionary approaches to finance, governance, and naval technology.",
