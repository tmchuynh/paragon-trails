    bio: "Yousef's deep knowledge of Marrakech's labyrinthine medina comes from seven generations of his family living in the same historic riad. Before guiding, he worked with UNESCO documentation projects mapping the medina's endangered architectural features and traditional crafts. As both a resident and certified historic preservationist, Yousef provides unique insights into how the medieval city functions as a living community rather than a museum. His specialty architectural tours reveal hidden elements tourists typically miss—from ingenious passive cooling systems to the social significance of doorway designs. With personal connections throughout the old city, Yousef arranges visits to private homes, active restoration projects, and multi-generational craft workshops normally inaccessible to visitors.",
