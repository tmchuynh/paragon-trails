# Activities Data Service

## Overview
The Activities data service provides functionality to fetch and transform activity data for the Paragon Trails application. This service has been migrated from static mock data to dynamic API-driven data using the DummyJSON products API.

## Service Architecture
- **Primary Data Source**: DummyJSON Products API via `ProductService`
- **Data Transformation**: Products are transformed into activity objects with travel-specific properties
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains legacy exports for existing components

## Exports

### Core Services
```typescript
export { ProductService } from "@/lib/api/services";
```

### Types
```typescript
export type { Activity } from "@/lib/interfaces/services/activities";
```

### Main Functions

#### `getMockActivities()`
Fetches and transforms product data into activity objects.

**Returns**: `Promise<Activity[]>`

**Usage**:
```typescript
const activities = await getMockActivities();
```

#### `getMockActivity(id: string)`
Retrieves a single activity by ID.

**Parameters**:
- `id`: Activity ID (format: "ACT###")

**Returns**: `Promise<Activity | null>`

**Usage**:
```typescript
const activity = await getMockActivity("ACT001");
```

### Legacy Exports
```typescript
export const mockActivities = []; // Empty array for backward compatibility
export { getMockActivities as mockActivities_async };
```

## Data Transformation

### Product to Activity Mapping
Each DummyJSON product is transformed into an activity with the following structure:

- **ID**: `ACT` + zero-padded product ID
- **Name**: Product title
- **Category**: Product category
- **Description**: Product description
- **Images**: Product thumbnail + additional images
- **Duration**: Random 1-8 hours
- **Difficulty**: Random Easy/Medium/Hard
- **Group Size**: Random min/max capacity
- **Pricing**: Adult, child, senior rates in USD
- **Location**: Generic location data
- **Schedule**: Daily frequency with multiple time slots
- **Inclusions/Exclusions**: Standard activity items
- **Rating**: Product rating or random 4-5 stars
- **Highlights**: Standard activity highlights

### Example Activity Object
```typescript
{
  id: "ACT001",
  name: "Mountain Hiking Adventure",
  category: "outdoor",
  description: "Experience breathtaking mountain trails...",
  duration: "6 hours",
  difficulty: "Medium",
  pricing: {
    adult: 150,
    child: 120,
    senior: 135,
    currency: "USD"
  },
  // ... additional properties
}
```

## Migration Notes

### From Static to Dynamic Data
- Previously used static mock data arrays
- Now fetches real product data from DummyJSON API
- Maintains same interface for consuming components
- Added error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Backward Compatibility
- Components using `mockActivities` will get empty array
- Components using `getMockActivities()` will get API data
- New async export `mockActivities_async` available

## Error Handling
- API failures are logged but don't crash the application
- Transformation errors are handled gracefully
- Fallback to empty arrays when necessary

## Performance Considerations
- Data is fetched on-demand
- No caching implemented (consider adding for production)
- Transformation happens in memory

## Dependencies
- `@/lib/api/services` - ProductService
- `@/lib/interfaces/services/activities` - Activity type definitions

## Future Enhancements
- Add caching layer for API responses
- Implement activity-specific API endpoints
- Add search and filtering capabilities
- Include real activity booking systems
