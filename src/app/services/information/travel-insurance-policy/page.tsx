          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            At Paragon Trails, we understand that travel is more than
            logistics—it's an investment in memories, experiences, and personal
            fulfillment. However, even the most meticulously planned journey can
            be impacted by unexpected events. That's why we strongly encourage
            all clients to protect their travels with comprehensive insurance
            coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Travel Insurance Policy outlines our recommendations,
            responsibilities, and guidance for obtaining coverage that meets
            your specific needs. While Paragon Trails does not directly sell
            insurance, we actively guide clients toward reputable providers and
            ensure that all trips—especially those involving remote
            destinations, luxury accommodations, or exclusive arrangements—are
            properly protected.

          <h2>Why Travel Insurance Is Essential</h2>
          <p>
            Travel insurance offers more than reimbursement—it offers
            confidence. As global travel becomes more dynamic and unpredictable,
            an insurance policy acts as a financial safety net, a medical
            resource, and a crisis response tool all in one. Without proper
            coverage, travelers may be responsible for substantial out-of-pocket
            expenses in unfamiliar legal or medical systems.
          </p>
          <p>Key reasons to secure travel insurance before departure:</p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4 pl-8 list-disc">
            <li>Sudden illness, injury, or hospitalization</li>
            <li>Family emergencies or bereavement</li>
            <li>Canceled flights or missed connections</li>
            <li>Lost passports, baggage, or personal items</li>
            <li>Travel supplier bankruptcy or strikes</li>
            <li>Natural disasters and civil unrest</li>
            <li>Personal emergencies requiring early return</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Required Coverage for Select Itineraries</h2>
          <p>
            For trips that include high-risk environments, remote regions, or
            medically underserved areas, Paragon Trails requires proof of travel
            insurance that meets the following minimums:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-2 mb-4 pl-8 list-disc">
            <li>Emergency Medical Treatment: $50,000 minimum</li>
            <li>Medical Evacuation & Repatriation: $100,000 minimum</li>
            <li>
              Trip Cancellation/Interruption: Equal to total booking value
            </li>
            <li>Baggage Loss/Theft: $2,000 minimum</li>
            <li>24/7 Emergency Assistance: Mandatory</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Clients will be notified in advance if their itinerary includes
            regions or activities that trigger insurance requirements.

          <p>
            We're proud to provide unforgettable journeys, but no trip is immune
            to disruption. A carefully chosen travel insurance policy is not a
            luxury—it's a necessity. Whether you're sailing the Aegean,
            exploring Patagonia, or enjoying a private safari, you deserve the
            peace of mind that only comprehensive protection can provide.
